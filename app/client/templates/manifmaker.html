            <h3>What is for ?</h3>

            <p class="text-justify">ManifMaker is a powerful app aimed to plan and organize events where
                volunteers take a great
                part.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">In a few words, users create
                <stong>tasks</stong>
                describing the job to be done, add <strong>time slot</strong> defining when the task
                has to be
                done and specify <strong>people needs</strong> to explicit how many and what kind of volunteers are
                needed to perform the
                task.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Volunteers register on the app and add a few <strong>availabilities</strong> and
                <strong>skills</strong> to detail when they want to work
                and what
                they can do.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">Once the tasks and their needs are validated, special users assign volunteers to
                tasks according to :
            <ul>
                <li> match between task's time slots and user's availabilities
                </li>
                <li> match between time slot's people needs and user's skills.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Once all the tasks and users are assigned, users can export their agenda which details the tasks they have to do and all related information.</p>
